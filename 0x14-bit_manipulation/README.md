Task 0- a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int
Task 1- a function that prints the binary representation of a number.Prototype: void print_binary(unsigned long int n);
Tasks 2- a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index. Prototype: int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index);
Tasks 3- a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index. Prototype: int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);
Tasks 4- a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index. Prototype: int clear_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);
Tasks 5- a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another. Prototype: unsigned int flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m);
Tasks 6-  a function that checks the endianness. Prototype: int get_endianness(void);
Tasks 7- Find the password for this program. Save the password in the file 101-password
